Dear Members of the Yale Community,
A number of you have received email messages from “Equity Prime Mortgage” that contain racist anti-black and violent content. These emails appear to be part of a nationwide act of hate; similar messages were sent to members of other universities.
The Yale Police Department and Information Technology Services are investigating. Yale also will coordinate with law enforcement and other universities to learn how and from whom the messages were sent, and what additional steps we can take to continue to provide cybersecurity support for the community. In addition, Yale’s Information Technology Services has advised that we should not open emails from “Equity Prime Mortgage.” If you receive such emails, please ignore or delete them.
These emails target black members of our community. Yale rejects these messages and all acts of hate and exclusion. We must respond by supporting one another and renewing our commitment to the life and work of Yale.
Sincerely,
