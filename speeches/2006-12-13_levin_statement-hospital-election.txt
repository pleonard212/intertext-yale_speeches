 Although Yale New Haven Hospital is not a part of Yale University, I serve on the hospital’s board of trustees, and I am dismayed by the recent actions of the hospital that violated the letter and spirit of its agreement with SEIU’s District 1199. Yale University assisted the two parties in negotiating this agreement to conduct a free and fair election, and I have consistently urged hospital management to abide by its terms. When the staff meetings reviewed by the arbitrator first came to my attention last week, I called for their immediate cessation.
I urge the hospital and the union to sit down and find a resolution that would restore a climate in which a fair, secret ballot election can be held. The University stands ready to assist the parties in finding a constructive solution.
