To the Yale Community,
This past academic year, Yale completed its regular ten-year reaccreditation review by the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE). A team of peer reviewers visited campus to assess the university according to NECHE’s Standards for Accreditation in November, and the commission conducted its evaluation review in early March. We received NECHE’s comprehensive evaluation letter at a time when urgent communications about health, safety, and continuity required our collective undivided attention. We now have the pleasure of sharing with you the successful outcome of the review process.
We encourage you to visit the Yale Accreditation website, where you can read the letter of evaluation confirming Yale’s continued accreditation, as well as several key documents that informed the commission’s review: Yale’s self-study, the peer committee’s report following the November site visit, and Yale’s formal response to that report.
The highly positive commentary that accompanies the visiting team’s assessment and the commission’s evaluation is a testament both to the pursuit of excellence that permeates our campus and to the thoughtful engagement shown by all of you throughout the self-study and review cycle. We thank the many faculty, staff, students, and alumni who contributed their time and insights, and we offer our special gratitude to the members of the self-study committees whose tireless efforts were instrumental to our success.
As the NECHE standards remind us, self-assessment and improvement are not isolated acts but continuous endeavors. Today we invite you to pause and reflect proudly on all we have accomplished as a community—and to look ahead to continuing this important work together.
Sincerely,
