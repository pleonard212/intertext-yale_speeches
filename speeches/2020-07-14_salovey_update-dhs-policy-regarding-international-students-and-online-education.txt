I am relieved and gratified that the Department of Homeland Security has agreed to withdraw its recent announcement. I understand that DHS will return to the policy it adopted in March, which allows continuing international students to study in the U.S. even if campuses move to online instruction. Yale is also committed to helping to solve this issue for new students.
 
Today’s decision is appropriate because it affirms to the world that the U.S. continues to welcome students from around the globe. It also gives campuses the leeway to make decisions about the fall term that protect the health and safety of faculty, students, and staff. I am grateful to my colleagues at universities across the country, especially Harvard and MIT, as well as Attorney General Tong and other attorneys general for acting swiftly to raise a successful legal challenge. My colleagues and I were pleased to be part of this collective effort.
