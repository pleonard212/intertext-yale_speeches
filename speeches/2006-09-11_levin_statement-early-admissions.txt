 Yale ended its binding Early Decision program in 2002 and substituted an Early Action Program to reduce the pressure on high school students. Under our Early Action Program, high school students can learn in December that Yale will accept them for entry the next September, but the students are free throughout the spring to decide to attend another college or university. This takes pressure off high school students to make a decision that they may later regret.
It is not clear that eliminating Early Admissions will result in the admission of more students from low-income families. Since such students are underrepresented in the Ivy League applicant pool, what is really needed is what Harvard, Yale and others have been doing in recent years: that is making efforts to increase the pool of low-income students who apply and strengthening the financial aid packages they receive.
