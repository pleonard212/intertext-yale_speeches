Dear Members of the Yale Community,
 
The past months have tested us, our country, and our world in ways few of us could have imagined. As we await the results of the presidential election, we know that, regardless of the outcome, great challenges lie ahead. The future will demand much of us as citizens, scholars, and leaders. 
 
In the words of former secretary of state and Morse College Fellow Madeleine Albright: “While democracy in the long run is the most stable form of government, in the short run, it is among the most fragile.” I am grateful to everyone who voted and to all who work to safeguard and strengthen our remarkable democracy. 
 
For over 300 years, Yale has prepared students for lives of meaning and purpose; we have created knowledge that serves humanity. As we look to the future, it is clear that the world needs your energy, talent, and leadership more than ever. We need people of high principle who, by seeking light and truth, advance the public good. In the face of uncertainty, we can find comfort and reassurance in Yale’s enduring mission and our continued responsibility—to improve the world today and for future generations.
