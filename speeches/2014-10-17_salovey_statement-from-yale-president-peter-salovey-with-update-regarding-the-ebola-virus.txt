I am delighted to report that Yale-New Haven Hospital has received a second confirmation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that our School of Public Health doctoral student does not have the Ebola virus. This is terrific news.
 
Despite this welcome outcome, both of the students who traveled recently to Liberia will continue to abide by the quarantine guidelines established by the State of Connecticut.
 
Once again, I would like to convey my thanks to everyone who has been involved in the excellent care and support provided to our students, both here at Yale, in the broader community, and especially at Yale-New Haven Hospital.
