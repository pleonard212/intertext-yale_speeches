Dear Members of the Yale Community,
The bells of the Yale Memorial Carillon in Harkness Tower will ring at noon today. One year ago, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, and our university had its first confirmed case of the disease. Since then, people across the world have made sacrifices, experienced loss, and worked intently to end the public health crisis.
Like communities around the globe, we have had to overcome great challenges in the past twelve months. We have grieved together, altered our lives to care for one another, and worked collaboratively to curb the pandemic. Through it all, you have ensured the continuity of Yale’s commitment to education, research, preservation, and practice of the highest caliber. Thank you for your resilience and service.
Let us all take a moment at noon—whether we are on campus or working remotely—to think about all those who have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and most especially those we have lost.
With gratitude and best wishes,

Peter Salovey
President
Chris Argyris Professor of Psychology
