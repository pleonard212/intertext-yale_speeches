Re:     A Shared and Ongoing Effort
To the Yale Community,
The work to build a more inclusive Yale—one characterized by and deeply committed to mutual respect—is shared by all of us. It did not begin with the announcement of our newest efforts, nor will it end when those initiatives have been completed. There will always be more we can do. 
As a global university dedicated to excellence in all its dimensions, Yale must always move forward. Our campus is a place of growth and of opportunity, a test-bed of change and a model for society. Together, we will lead the way toward a stronger Yale—and a stronger world.
So that you can follow and contribute to our progress, I invite you to bookmark the web page we have launched at http://president.yale.edu/working-toward-better-yale. It will be updated on an ongoing basis to reflect the most recent news and steps taken. Please check back regularly for the latest details on our related programs and activities.
Sincerely,
Peter Salovey
President and Chris Argyris Professor of Psychology
