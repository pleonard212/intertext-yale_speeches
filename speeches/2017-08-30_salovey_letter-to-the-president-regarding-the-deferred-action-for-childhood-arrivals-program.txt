This is the text of a letter sent to President Trump from Yale President Peter Salovey on August 30, 2017.
Dear Mr. President,
I am writing to express my urgent hope that you will choose to maintain and defend the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.
The young people who benefit from DACA have overcome significant challenges, demonstrating the talent, values, and grit that foreshadow their contributions to the civic and economic life of our country. A decision to maintain DACA will allow Congress time to act on legislation to establish a legal pathway to citizenship for Dreamers. It will provide a level of security for the Dreamers who trusted the government’s promise that they would be shielded from deportation if they self-identified, registered with federal law enforcement agencies, and passed an extensive background investigation.
I acknowledge that we must modernize a system of immigration that most agree is broken. Nonetheless, I believe we can and should first ensure that Dreamers can continue to have the peace of mind that DACA offers while Congress seeks to establish a legislative solution.
We are a nation of laws, but we are also a nation of immigrants who have sought, generation after generation, the promise of opportunity. The Dreamers participating in DACA have embraced the United States as their home, and we should affirm that they have a future in our great country. Doing so is consistent with our longstanding values as a nation of immigrants motivated by the search for a better life.
Sincerely,
Peter Salovey
President
