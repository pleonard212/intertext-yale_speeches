I am pleased to say that the Yale Corporation at its most recent meeting approved a measure amending the University’s Equal Opportunity Statement explicitly to protect gender identity and expression. With this step, the University expressly affirms that discrimination on the basis of these factors is unacceptable at Yale, as is discrimination based on any of the other listed grounds, and that all members of the University community enjoy the protection of the policy as so amended.

The Equal Opportunity Statement now reads as follows:

“The University is committed to basing judgments concerning the admission, education, and employment of individuals upon their qualifications and abilities and affirmatively seeks to attract to its faculty, staff, and student body qualified persons of diverse backgrounds. In accordance with this policy and as delineated by federal and Connecticut law, Yale does not discriminate in admissions, educational programs, or employment against any individual on account of that individual’s sex, race, color, religion, age, disability, status as a special disabled veteran, veteran of the Vietnam era or other covered veteran, or national or ethnic origin; nor does Yale discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity or expression.”

Please be sure that any publications in your schools and programs (including any web pages) that carry the Statement reflect the new language, which consists of the final phrase, “or gender identity or expression.” Web pages should be modified immediately; print publications at the next scheduled printing. Should there be any questions as to the effect of this change in particular circumstances where sex-based distinctions exist in facilities or programs, you should bring these to the attention of the Provost or the Vice President and General Counsel.
