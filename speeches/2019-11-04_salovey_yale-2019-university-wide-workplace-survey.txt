Dear Colleagues,
You can now participate in Yale’s 2019 University-wide Workplace Survey, and I urge you to do so. You may access and complete the survey online at www.2019workplacesurvey.com. We need your feedback to help create and sustain a community where everyone has opportunities to contribute and feels a sense of belonging. The survey should take less than fifteen minutes to complete and will be available through midnight on Sunday, November 24. Your individual responses will be completely confidential and will be seen only by the external firm that administers the survey.
Yale’s Workplace Survey provides the university with important information about employee satisfaction, work unit and supervisor effectiveness, workplace communications, and organizational culture. The responses are used to develop action plans for improvements in departments as well as across the university. For more information, visit www.your.yale.edu/conversations.
Thank you in advance for sharing your views on your workplace. Your input is of vital importance to me.
Sincerely,
Peter Salovey
President
Chris Argyris Professor of Psychology
