To the Yale Alumni Community,
As you likely are aware, we are in the midst of a very public debate about racism, diversity, and free expression at Yale. Tensions on campus—and beyond—are running high. Dean Holloway and I have heard from many of you in response to the events of the past two weeks, and I am grateful that you have taken the time to share your perspectives with us and offer your support.
Already we have seen a number of constructive responses by the campus community. On Monday, more than 1,000 people took part in a peaceful “March for Resilience” organized by students. Our four cultural centers are giving visible leadership and providing space and opportunity for conversation and support. Members of the faculty are offering “teach-ins.”
Even in difficult times—indeed, all the more so in the face of community challenges like those we are experiencing now—Yale stands firm in its commitment to protect the free and open exchange of ideas, and to do so on a campus that values civility and respect. Dean Holloway and I sent messages to the Yale College community last week and wrote to all faculty, students, and staff yesterday evening with the update that is copied below.
We are working now to develop a suite of initiatives focused on improving our campus climate and fostering diversity, and will write again next week to share further details. In the meantime, I send heartfelt appreciation for your care and concern for Yale.
Sincerely,
