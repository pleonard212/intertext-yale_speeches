In response to the June 18, 2020, U.S. Supreme Court ruling regarding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, Yale University President Peter Salovey said, “I am relieved that Yale students and graduates covered under DACA will be able to continue working and making significant contributions to our country as a result of this decision. I am also reminded that today’s decision does not provide an enduring solution for these talented, hardworking young people. We still need legislation that provides a pathway to legal status—and ultimately citizenship—for undocumented students. These students have so much potential. We need to give them the chance to thrive and to help make our nation stronger and more innovative.”
