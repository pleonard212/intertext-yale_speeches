Dear Members of the Yale Community,
I write with deep sadness to share the news that Kevin Jiang, a graduate student at the Yale School of the Environment, was shot and killed last night near the intersection of Nash Street and Lawrence Street. The New Haven Police Department is treating this incident as a homicide and is actively working on apprehending the person or people responsible.
My office has been in close contact with members of Kevin’s family. I wish to convey to them and to all others who loved Kevin my sincere condolences. Kevin was an extraordinary young man; the School of the Environment will be holding a community gathering later today and will be planning additional remembrance events that will be posted on the school’s website.
Mayor Justin Elicker and I have been in touch with each other throughout the night. I have asked Yale Police Chief Ronnell Higgins to update you later today on the investigation and measures we and the city are taking to protect the members of our shared community. We will continue to focus on the security and safety of our students, faculty, staff, and neighbors.
It is difficult to process this tragedy. If you need support, please reach out to Yale Mental Health & Counseling (business hours: 203-432-0290; after hours: 203-432-0123). The chaplain’s office is also here for you; you can reach them at 203-432-1128 or make an appointment through chaplain.yale.edu.
My wife, Marta, and I join with you in remembering Kevin and grieving with his family and friends.
