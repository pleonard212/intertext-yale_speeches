To the members of the Yale community: 
An executive order signed by President Trump on Friday restricting the entry of individuals from seven countries into the United States may affect members of our community. We share in your concern regarding this situation and assure the community that we are working closely with students and scholars who are directly affected.
We are also in touch with our colleagues at other universities and the Association of American Universities (AAU), of which Yale is a member. The AAU has issued a statement urging a quick end to the administrative order barring returning students and faculty from certain countries, available here. We will continue to monitor the situation and to explore the best options available in response.
More information is on the website of the Office of International Students and Scholars and will be updated regularly.
Sincerely,
Peter Salovey, President and Chris Argyris Professor of Psychology 
Benjamin Polak, Provost and William C. Brainard Professor of Economics
Kimberly Goff-Crews, Secretary and Vice President for Student Life
