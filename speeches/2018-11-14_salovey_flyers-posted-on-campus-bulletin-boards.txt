To the Yale Community,
I have received reports that two people whose faces were covered posted racially provocative flyers on campus bulletin boards last night. I find the sentiments signified by these flyers deeply troubling, and I want to be clear: hate is not welcome on our campus.
We do not know yet if these signs were put up by members of the Yale community or by external parties. This incident is currently being investigated, but we do know that the flyers violated Yale’s rules as they were not put up by a registered student organization. We have informed the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors incidents of hate around the country, and the Anti-Defamation League, which tracks incidents of this kind and has reported an increase in white nationalist and anti-Semitic incidents on college campuses nationwide. Please remember that information on reporting discrimination and harassment and on support resources may be found at https://belong.yale.edu/.
As I have said in the past, the answer to speech one finds repugnant is more speech. I have no doubt that the members of the Yale community will respond to expressions of hate, racism, and exclusion on this campus with even stronger affirmations of our values—and a renewed commitment to creating a diverse, inclusive community where all people are welcomed. Thank you for joining me in this important and ongoing work.
Sincerely,
Peter Salovey
